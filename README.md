## Instructions

This project is part of the Front End Web Developer course, provided by Udacity and Google. As FEND student, I've been provided with a starter project, the starter project had some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game. My task was to make it interactive and responsive.

## Usage

In this game you've got 16 cards, 8 pairs, match them all to win!
